## What is it?
This script was created with the help of 88lex. It uses portion of his amazing sasync (https://github.com/88lex/sasync) script. This was written mainly for CloudBox users but can be utilized by anyone.

# Requirements
 1. Any dependencies needed are taken care of by the script besides rclone.
 2. rclone: `curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash` | Minimum version of 1.51 but 1.52 is recommended.
  

## Installation
1. `cd /opt`

2. `git clone https://github.com/Visorask/sarotate.git`

3. `sudo chown -R user:group sarotate` - Run `id` to find your user / group.

4. `cd /opt/sarotate && chmod +x sarotate`

5. `nano config.yml` Edit the variables to match your settings. Save and close.

6. You will also need the latest rclone, minimum version = 1.52. ```curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash```

7. Once you have done all this then you will need to restart the mounts you want to rotate before running this script. A command might look like this: ```sudo systemctl restart <example>.service```

  Otherwise you might get an error like this:
```
Failed to rc: Failed to read rc response: 404 Not Found: {
        "error": "couldn't find method \"backend/command\"",
        "input": {
                "command": "set",
                "fs": "<remotename>:",
                "opt": {
                        "service_account_file": "<file/path/1.json>"
                }
        },
        "path": "backend/command",
        "status": 404
}
```

### Extra Information 
   For the script to work you must edit your mounts to have either `--rc-no-auth` or `--rc-user=<username>` and `--rc-pass=<password>`. You can add those into a live mount by doing:
  
   - `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/<nameofmount>.service` (Fill in <nameofmount> with your information.)
   - `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
   - `sudo systemctl restart /etc/systemd/system/<nameofmount>.service` (Fill in <nameofmount> with your information.)
   - `./sarotate -c <config>.yml`
